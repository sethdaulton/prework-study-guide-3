# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This prework study guide contains some notes on HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. It was created and assembled in the month of August 2022 in Georgetown, TX.

I built this project to better understand the ins and outs of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git/GitHub.

It offers a one stop shop for notes on each of the topics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git).

I learned about each of these topics through the creation of this website. 

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Usage

Each section of this study guide contain notes for each topic. I tried to be as thorough as possible in taking down the information and keeping it as a useful record here. 

For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
